In this milestone, the MiniJava editor from the previous milestone is extended with semantic analyses. The extended editor should be able

* to resolve references in a MiniJava program,
* to calculate types of MiniJava expressions,
* to report semantic errors, warnings, and notes, and

## Initial Projects

We provide you with a template for this milestone. The template covers the concrete and abstract
syntax of MiniJava and desugarings.  For grading purposes, you are required to use this project as a
starting point for milestone 2. You should use `minijava.test.names` for assignment 4, and
`minijava.test.types` for assignment 6.

## Resources

You can find the *MiniJava Language Reference Manual* in the appendix of the book
*Modern Compiler Implementation in Java* (2nd edition).
The relevant pages are available on [Google books](http://books.google.com/books?id=JNs6fWkJZbAC&pg=PA484).

The [MiniJava project](http://www.cambridge.org/us/features/052182060X/)
by Joao Cangussu, Jens Palsberg and Vidyut Samanta provides some example programs
and an HTML version of the reference manual.
